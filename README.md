# AP Music Theory Practice (Work In Progress)
### Infinite Generator of AP Music Theory practice questions, including both aural and nonaural multiple choice questions and free response questions.

The eventual goal is to provide infinite generated practice for all AP exams, starting with the courses with some of the fewest official released practice questions, like AP Music Theory.

Additionally, once every type of question for a given course is successfully made available, full-length practice exams will also be available. There will be integrated grading based on AP standards for each section of the exams, and a composite score calculator based on the most recently released AP exam curves.

I also plan to include a guided practice option, where explanations are provided as the student completes a problem, rather than after grading has taken place.
